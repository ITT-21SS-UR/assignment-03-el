a) Which advantages do direct pointing devices have over indirect pointing devices? Name one use case where using a direct pointing device would not make any sense.

Direct pointing devices have the advantage over indirect ones in that the user can usually use them intuitively. For example even people without much experience with technical devices - like elderly or very young people - can quickly understand that a stylus can be used on a tablet just like a pen on paper.
With indirect pointing devices the user have to make the mental effort to translate the movement from the pointing devices to the movement on the device.
However, this translation makes it possible to operate a mouse, for example, much more precisely than a finger on a touchpad. But especially on very large screens, it is only advantageous that a small movement of the mouse results in a larger movement of the cursor on the monitor. In a multi-monitor environment, it would be unthinkable to work only with direct pointing devices.

b) How would you characterize “Shift” based on the classification criteria mentioned in the Wikipedia article?

We would characterize the "SHIFT" as follows:
    direct input: Although a representation of the hidden section including the on-screen pointer is displayed at a different location on the screen, the actual target is located at the same physical position as the finger on the touchscreen.

    absolute movement: A movement of the finger on the touchscreen is converted into a movement of the cursor without translation.

    position control: Changing the position of the finger on the touchscreen directly change the position of the pointer.

    isometric: It's isometric, because the toucscreen as input device is unmovable.

    translation: The touchscreen measures translation movements of the finger or stylus.

    degrees of freedom: 3 degrees (translation (x,y and z) with x and y movements on the screen and z the lifting of the finger)

    possible states: Like normal touchscreens SHIFT has the status "out of range" and "tracking". In addition to these two states, an target is selected by lifting the finger.
			

c) What is the size of the display used in the study?

The study used a PDA with a display size of 550 x 730 mm or respectively 240 x 320 px.
